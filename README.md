# Crowdfunding_ETL - Project 2

### Introduction
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.


### The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:
    Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
    Create the Campaign DataFrame
    Create the Contacts DataFrame
    Create the Crowdfunding Database
